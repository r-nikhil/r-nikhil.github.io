title: Why do I write? 
---

Over the last week, 4-5 folks have asked me why I write or why do I maintain this blog? This post attempts to answer the question and ensures I don't have to repeat myself again. 

- It's very important to write well than most people realize. Writing doesn't just communicate ideas; it generates them. If you're bad at writing and don't like to do it, you'll miss out on most of the ideas writing would have generated. [[1]](https://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html) I publish it online because an audience makes you write more and therefore generate more ideas. 

    - The best post on this site according to me is ["How to bundle games?"](https://rnikhil.com/2023/04/09/multi-vs-single-gaming.html). The idea behind that post was brewing in my head for a couple months but it took serious sitting down at a keyboard to put them into words. Even after pondering over it for a while, 80% of the ideas in that post happened after I started writing it. 
    - While talking about your ideas is a good way to develop them, you will almost always discover new things when you sit down to write. Putting ideas into words is a severe test [[2]](https://www.paulgraham.com/words.html)

- A lot of my posts are just personal notes slightly face lifted with some diagrams for publication. It doesn't cost me a lot of time and maintaining this blog is a way to ensure I don't lose them when I inevitably switch computers or note taking apps. I really regret not writing as much back in 2015-2020 and I genuinely wish I wrote more when I was learning about computer security. 

- Sometimes, I write about my experiences which are unique and could be certainly useful to people who are in a similar situation in their life. My most popular blog post ["Downsides of a professional poker career"](https://rnikhil.com/2023/11/12/quitting-fulltime-poker.html) which got about 180k views was written entirely on a whim while waiting for my flight on a late Sunday night. I got a bunch of inbound saying that the post was insightful. 
    - Useful writing tells people something true and important that they didn't already know, and tells them as unequivocally as possible. Any insight I may have will probably have already been had by at least one of the world's 7.5 billion people. But it's sufficient if an idea is novel to a lot of readers.

- Sometimes, I write because I want to voice my opinion on a particular topic. My post on [online privacy and tornado cash](https://rnikhil.com/2022/08/09/tornado-cash-block.html) sparked a ton of new discussion on a lot of forums. I unquestionably care about those topics and this blog is a way for me to speak up and add my two cents. 

- You do a lot of research when you write a post. Writing in a way forces structure into my research and I learn a lot more about a topic when I write about it than just reading couple articles and papers. For example, I have been teaching myself LLM security for the last 6 months. However, when I decided to start writing about them, it forced me to do a ton of new research and I learnt a lot of new stuff along the way. 

- And finally, here is one of my [comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35936828#35967811) on HN about 7 months ago on writing. Its a thread about the British art critic [David Sylvester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sylvester)

- I also write publicly because I hate repeating myself and I can just point folks to a post - like this one.
