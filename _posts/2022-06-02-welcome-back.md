- Its been a while since I updated the website. While trying to setup a Jekyll environment, I ended up in dependency hell and decided to just boot the entire ruby installation instead of fixing the circular configs. This time, I am using a theme called [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) in its dark mode version. You may notice some parts of the website still broken or unfinished. Apologies!

- I would also be uploading posts/notes which I've wanted to share earlier while I was building my startup in poker (spoiler alert: It didn't work out). It was a post game study tool for PLO professionals. 

- I am currently working on building the poker product at [Paytm First Games](https://firstgames.in/) under [Abhishek Kumar](https://mobile.twitter.com/shakyabhishek). We recently launched tournaments and PLO is coming next. After I wrapped my startup, I was looking for opportunities in the poker ecosystem and this was a perfect one. Will be writing more about my work here in future posts. 

- In my spare time, I've been building some arb bots using Flashbots trying to capture [MEV](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/mev/). I've started doing this after losing a significant percent of my net worth in the recent crash yield farming and leverage trading shit coins. I don't play much PLO these days apart from some private games.
