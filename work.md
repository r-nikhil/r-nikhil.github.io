#### Projects

Projects I have worked on in no particular order.

* **PintOS**

Extended the OS by adding virtual memory, message passing queues, POSIX threads and OS-level semaphores. Implemented "fork" and "exec" system calls and the ability to run user program. Implemented indexed filesystem, hierarchical directory structure and buffer cache.

_Technologies Used_: C

* **Tracker**

It is to help developers jump start developing any kind of mobility tracking applications. Tracker let's any type or number of GPS enabled endpoints to send data to a NodeJs server which then maps their location history using Google Maps API. 

_Technologies Used_: Javascript, NodeJS, Google Maps API

* **Portsmith**

A secure Port Knocking Implementation in Python using single packet authorization. Uses TCP and IND-CCA secure requests to open a port on the server. Uses hping3 to craft TCP packets. The knock packet is encrypted using the key transferred from the server and then sent to the knockport. It gets logged into kern.log which is read by Portsmith. It is then decrypted and the required port is then opened for the sourceIP using a custom iptables command. There is also an integrated SOCKS proxy to perform knocks before routing application traffic. Currently working on a kernel module implementation using Netfilter hooks, nftables and cryptographic primitives instead of high level libraries.

_Technologies Used_: Python, Cryptography Library( Fernet Symmetric Encryption )

* **Peer to Peer Streaming Protocol**

Was involved in the building a statistics module for an application layer streaming protocol in Python. It records information related to the stream, number of peers (audience) per minute, in/out of peers, total peers, etc. Wrote an graphical interface for viewing the numbers built using d3.js.

_Technologies Used_: Python, HTML/CSS, Javascript (D3.js)

* **MicroTracer**

System Call tracer for Linux based systems which displays the syscalls used by a particular program in a neatly formatted manner without the complex details as shown by programs like strace. 

_Technologies Used_: C

#### Publications

* Economic Analysis of Data Breaches

Collected data about recent data breaches in the last one year to build a regression model for prediction and prevention of data breaches. Research thesis indicated that lack of policy understanding and low expenditure to be major factors for breaches. Successfully presented it as my undergraduate thesis for the M.Sc Economics Degree.
