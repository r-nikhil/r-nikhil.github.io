title: Why start a link blog? 

---

I read a lot of content on twitter, 100s of blogs, articles and research papers. However, if you ask my opinion on something 6 months later which I had previously read about, I usually have to redo the research again. This section of my website is going to bridge that gap. About 80% of the posts on the home page are heavily researched with me spending weeks learning about the topic and days writing about them. I won't be doing that for this section and I don't plan on spending more than 4hrs a week on this. The posts are going to be shorter too. 

This is going to a [link blog](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/), where I will quote generously and liberally repost (with proper attribution) things I find interesting. I will try to add something extra like my own take or spin on the topic. You can think of this as a newsletter for recent updates in tech.
